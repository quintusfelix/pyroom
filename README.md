PyRoom Project 
==============
A fork due to inactivity by the original maintainer
---------------------------------------------------

PyRoom is a fullscreen simple text editor, without a toolbar, a menubar or
anything that would distract the user from his most important task: writing.
Note: as of writing the testing branch will have new features and 
master will recieve some kind of longer term work, that should work

Dependencies
------------

PyRoom depends on Python 3, PyGi and XDG bindings for Python (xdg). Please
refer to your system documentation for information on how to install these
modules if they're not currently available.
Optional: install via  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional dependencies
---------------------

In order to use GNOME default fonts in PyRoom, gconf bindings (python-gconf)
are recommended.

If you're installing manually from our tarball and want to use PyRoom in your
own language, you'll need to install gettext.

Installing and Running 
----------------------

PyRoom is available as a distutils enabled package. Installation procedures
for those are easy:

Either unpack the tarball 
```    
tar xvfz pyroom*.tar.gz
```

or check out our git repo for a development version (we try to keep those
unbroken and ready for production use)
```    
git clone https://github.com/LordBurtz/pyroom
```

From there, you can either run pyroom from commandline
```
cd pyroom/
./pyroom
```

Or install it system wide
```
cd pyroom
python3 setup.py install # as root
pyroom
```

Usage
